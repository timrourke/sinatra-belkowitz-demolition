# Belkowitz Demolition

A fake Sinatra site for an imaginary demolition company. Much like my other fake Sinatra site, [10volt Engineering](https://github.com/timrourke/sinatra-10volt-engineering)

This site is a very simple exploration of using Sinatra to serve static sites built with ERB templates.

## Tech used:
- Ruby
- Sinatra
- Sass
- Gulp for build tasks

In addition to learning ERB templates, this project was one of the first opportunities I've had to teach myself Ruby-based application deployment using Unicorn and Nginx.
